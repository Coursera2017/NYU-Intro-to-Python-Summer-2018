# Hello World!
Pick a partner who you don't know. Have one person act as the driver and one act as the navigator. You will be using one computer to go through these steps.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository
In GitHub, create a new repository called pair-programming-June-6th

## Step 2: Clone the Repository
In GitHub, go to the repository you just created
```
git clone <new repository>
```

## Step 3: Open up the Repository in Atom
Where you cloned the repository, open up that folder and create a new file called `hello_world.md`.

Inside the file type something like this
```
# Hello!
Hello world! I'm so stoked about this class  
```

## Step 4: Add this back to GitHub
```
git add hello_world.md
git commit -m "adding hello world file"
git push
```
